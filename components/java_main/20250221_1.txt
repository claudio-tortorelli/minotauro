Create a Java 1.8 compatible main class named Minotauro as a part of a maven POM project.
This class is executable and take parameters from command line.
When it starts it must print the tool version on standard output.
Version informations come from project resources or by POM.

Then it do the command line argument parsing examinating the possibile switches: 
if there is --c or --config then the next argument is the path of the custom configuration file.
Any other switch is not accepted and the tool must exit with 1 printing the help on the standard error.
If no argument is provided, then it will use a configuration file path that must be in the same folder of the tool.
This argument parsing must be done in a private function called inside main.

Then the tool initialize the logger based on SLF4J and it put at log level read by configuration.

When the tool ends without errors it return to the system the 0 value.

Create a Java 1.8 compatible main class.
This class can be executable from command line.
When it starts it must print the tool version on standard output.

Then it do the command line argument parsing examinating the possibile switches: 
if there is --c or --config then the next argument is the path of the custom configuration file.
Any other switch is not accepted and the tool must exit with 1 printing the help on the standard error.
If no argument is provided, then it will use a configuration file path that must be in the same folder of the tool.

Then the tool begin to initialize the logger.

When the tool ends without errors it return to the system the 0 value.
